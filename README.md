## Store
This is a very basic project that I created to apply different concepts in Java that I learned.
There is a store with 10 items that are held within an ArrayList titled itemInStock.
These 10 items have two identities - name and a price.
There is another ArrayList titled cartList which is for the user to create a grocery list, only with the 10 items that are in stock.
The user is prompted with a question - "What would you like to do?"
The user can use 6 answers to respond
* "check cart" - This will show everything within the User's cart
* "add to cart" - This will allow the User to add one of the 10 items that are in stock to their cart
* "remove from cart" - This will allow the User to remove something from their cart
* "check item price" - This will tell the User the price of one of the in stock items that they input
* "check cart price" - This will add the User's cart together and tell the User their total cart cost
* "stop" - This will end the questioning of the User
